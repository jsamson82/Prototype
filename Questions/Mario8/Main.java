Since mario is 5â€™1 he is able to get into the pipes to clean them. 
The pipe looks different today though, he decides to enter the pipe 
and comes out into the unfamiliar world of Mushroom Kingdom. He notices 
that everything seems different in this world and wants to explore!
He can either go left, up, or right. Modify the code so that it does not 
continuously loop through the while loop.
