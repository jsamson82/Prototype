*This activity is meant to teach the user the importance of loops and how to use both “for” and “while” loops. 
*By completing this activity, the user will be able to understand the syntax of “for” and “while” loops, 
*be able to create their own “for” and “while” loops, and understand why loops are so important to computer programming.

1.The student will first download the zipped file and drag the file into a code editor(I suggest VS code through github/gitpod)
2.Once the file is open on the code editor, the user should see two folders, an answers folder and a questions folder.
3.Open the “questions” folder and start with activity “Mario1”
4.If struggling, there are sometimes comments on the bottom of the code that will help.
5.Once an activity is finished, go to the answers folder and check the corresponding file
    ***some activities do not require the code to be edited, therefore there are no answer files for those activities.
6.The student will then work their way through all of the activities.
7.The user can check their work by opening the “Answers” folder and going to the corresponding “Mario1” answer file.
8.There are 10 activities and the whole project should take about one ram day.
